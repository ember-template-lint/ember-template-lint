Changelog
=========

## v0.6.3

- Add support for Handlebars comments.
  
  A few new types of control statements are now available:
    * `{{! template-lint-enable some-rule-name }}` - This will enable the rule `some-rule-name` with the default configuration (from `.template-lintrc.js`) or `true` (if not present in the config file). This can be ran for multiple rules at once (i.e. `{{! template-lint-enable bare-strings some-other-thing }}`).
    * `{{! template-lint-disable some-rule-name }}` - This will disable the rule `some-rule-name`. Multiple rules can be provided at once (i.e. `{{! template-lint-disable bare-strings some-other-thing }}`).
    * `{{! template-lint-configure some-rule-name { "whitelist": ["some", "valid", "json"] } }}` - This configures the rule `some-rule-name` with the `JSON.parse()`'ed result of the second argument.  The configure instruction only applies toa  single rule at a time.
  
  These configuration instructions do not modify the rule for the rest of the template, but instead only modify it within whatever DOM scope the comment instruction appears.

  An instruction will apply to all later siblings and their descendants:

  ```hbs
  {{! disable for <p> and <span> and their contents, but not for <div> or <hr> }}
  <div>
    <hr>
    {{! template-lint-disable }}
    <p>
      <span>Hello!</span>
    </p>
  </div>
  ```

  An in-element instruction will apply to only that element:

  ```hbs
  {{! enable for <p>, but not for <div>, <hr> or <span> }}
  <div>
    <hr>
    <p {{! template-lint-enable }}>
      <span>Hello!</span>
    </p>
  </div>
  ```

  An in-element instruction with the -tree suffix will apply to that element and all its descendants:

  ```hbs
  {{! configure for <p>, <span> and their contents, but not for <div> or <hr> }}
  <div>
    <hr>
    <p {{! template-lint-configure-tree block-indentation "tab" }}>
      <span>Hello!</span>
    </p>
  </div>
  ```

- Deprecate using HTML comments for enabling/disabling rules. Support for HTML comments will be removed in v0.7.0.

## v0.6.2

- Add `ignore` to allowed configuration values. `ignore` is an array of moduleId's that are to be completely ignored. This is similar (but different) from `pending`.
- Add `unused-block-params` rule. The following example would fail this rule (since it has an unused block param `index`):

```hbs
{{#each foo as |bar index|}}
  {{bar}}
{{/each}}
```
- Update `img-alt-attributes` rule to allow `<img alt>` and `<img alt="">`.
- Update `invalid-interactive` rule to allow `<form {{action 'foo' on="submit"}}>`.


## v0.6.1

- Fix issue with new `deprecated-inline-view-helper` (throwing error when parsing mustache statements).

## v0.6.0

- Add `invalid-interactive` to recommended rules.
- Add `img-alt-attributes` to recommended rules.
- Add `style-concatenation` to recommended rules.
- Add `deprecated-inline-view-helper` to recommended rules.
- Add `link-rel-noopener` to recommended rules.
- Remove support for Node 0.10.

## v0.5.18

- Add `deprecated-inline-view-helper` rule. Usage of `{{view` / `{{#view` helper and `{{view.path.here}}` were deprecated in Ember 1.13, and subsequently removed in Ember 2.0.
  This rule flags these usages.

## v0.5.17

- Fix issue with the `invalid-interactive` rule not honoring the documented `additonalInteractiveTags` option.

## v0.5.16

- Fix issue with `link-rel-noopener` rule when using properly with a listing (i.e. `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- Add `inline-link-to` rule to prevent usage of inline `{{link-to`.
- Add `style-concatenation` rule. This prevents the usage of `<div style="{{make-background url}}">` (quoted value with any dynamic segments) but allows
  `<div style={{make-background url}}>`.

## v0.5.15

- Fix issue causing `<iframe>` to be detected as `{{#if`.
- Add `link-rel-noopener` rule. This rule requires that any `<a target="_blank">` have a `rel="noopener"`. This prevents the newly opened window from having access
  to the opener (and helps prevent a number of phishing attacks).

## v0.5.14

- Fix `invalid-indentation` rule to allow scenarios where the opening and closing elements can have no space between. For example:

```hbs
<textarea
    class="form-control"
    id="job-instructions"
    rows="3"
    placeholder="Do it well"
    value={{job.instructions}}
    oninput={{action 'updateInstructions' value='target.value'}}></textarea>
```

  If the above `</textarea>` had been after a newline and indented properly, the default contents of the textarea would then include that whitespace. The rule now enforces
  that there be no child elements within a given block.

- Remove a few ARIA roles that were incorrectly flagging things as interactive elements (i.e. `dialog` and `alertdialog`).

## v0.5.13

- Fix bug with `invalid-interactive` rule incorrectly flagging valid elements.

## v0.5.12

- Change `nested-interactive` rule to ignore elements using `tabindex` when determining if a parent element is interactive. `tabindex` is still used
  for detecting all child elements once already inside of another interactive element.
- Fix various issues with `nested-interactive` and `<label>`.
  - Consider `<label>` an interactive element.
  - Specifically handle the various edge cases of having `<label><input></label>`.
  - Prevent multiple interactive elements inside of a `<label>`.
- Fix bugs with the `invalid-indentation` around escaped mustaches and raw blocks.
- Add `invalid-interactive` rule ([full documentation](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint#invalid-interactive)).
  Adding interactivity to an element that is not naturally interactive content leads to a very poor experience for
  users of assistive technology (i.e. screen readers). In order to ensure that screen readers can provide useful information
  to their users, we should add an appropriate `role` attribute when the underlying element would not have made that
  role obvious.

  This rule forbids the following:

```hbs
<div {{action 'foo'}}></div>
```

  Instead, you should add a `role` to the element in question so that the A/T is aware that it is interactive:

```hbs
<div role="button" {{action "foo"}}></div>
```

- Add `img-alt-attributes` rule ([full documentation](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint#img-alt-attributes)).
  An `<img>` without an `alt` attribute is essentially invisible to assistive technology (i.e. screen readers).
  In order to ensure that screen readers can provide useful information, we need to ensure that all `<img>` elements
  have an `alt` specified. See [WCAG Suggestion H37](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html).

  The rule forbids the following:

```hbs
<img src="rwjblue.png">
```

  Instead, you should write the template as:

```hbs
<img src="rwjblue.png" alt="picture of Robert Jackson">
```

## v0.5.11

- Add internal helper for determining if a given element is an interactive element.
- Update `nested-interactive` rule to use the new `isInteractiveElement` helper function.
- Change `nested-interactive` configuration.  Now uses an object (instead of an array). Example:

```js
rules: {
  'nested-interactive': {
    ignoredTags: ['a', 'button'], // list of tag names to ignore
    ignoreTabindex: true, // ignore the tabindex check
    ignoreUsemapAttribute: ['img', 'object'], // ignore `usemap` check for specific tag names
    additionalInteractiveTags: ['some-custom-tag'], // not sure this is needed, but it seams neat :P
  }
}
```

## v0.5.10

- Add ability to mark specific rules as pending for a module. Given the following `.template-lintrc.js` file, the `foo/bar/baz` module would have only its indentation related issues labeled as warnings:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: 'recommended',
  pending: [
    { moduleId: 'foo/bar/baz', only: ['block-indentation']}
  ]
}
```

All other rules with errors in the `foo/bar/baz` template would still be reported as errors.

## v0.5.9

- Update internals to use better API for traversing nodes in template AST.
- Lock down parser version (should make package more stable as loose deps won't break consumers).

## v0.5.8

- Fix various issues with `block-indentation` rule:
  - Ensure that usage of whitespace control in end block does not trigger an error. Before this: `{{#if foo}}{{~/if}}` would error.
  - Validate indentation for block inverse (aka `{{else}}`).

## v0.5.7

- Fix a bug with `block-indentation` rule that would throw an error if a block contained a comment.
- Fixed bugs upstream in HTMLBars that caused location information to be incorrect for attributes and comments.

## v0.5.6

- Remove `bare-strings` from `recommended` configuration. See [#27](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint/pull/27) for more details.

## v0.5.5

- Fix invalid rule name in `recommended` configuration.
- Add ability to mark files as `pending` in the `.template-lintrc.js` configuration file.  When a module is listed in the `pending` list, it will be checked but any errors detected will be marked as warnings (and will not trigger a failing test when using ember-cli-template-lint). If there are no errors detected when checking a pending file, a new error will be triggered. The goal of this process is to allow large existing projects begin utilizing `ember-template-lint` / `ember-cli-template-lint` and slowly fix their template files to comply with the rules here.  Feedback welcome on this idea/process...

## v0.5.4

- Move rule configuration into `rules` property inside `.tempalte-lintrc.js`. Configuration in the root is still supported,
  but triggers a deprecation warning. Migration should be very straigtforward.

  Before:

  ```js
  // .template-lintrc.js
  module.exports = {
    'bare-strings': true
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  // .template-lintrc.js
  module.exports = {
    rules: {
      'bare-strings': true
    }
  }
  ```

## v0.5.3

- Add ability to extend from internally managed configurations.
- Add `recommended` configuration, which can be used via the following in your `.template-lintrc.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: 'recommended'
}
```

## v0.5.2

- Add `fix` information to the results object for:
  - `html-comments`
  - `self-closing-void-elements`
  - `deprecated-each-syntax`
- Add support for context shifting `{{#each` (i.e. `{{#each posts}}`) to the `deprecated-each-syntax`.

## v0.5.1

- Bring back rules lost during migration from ember-cli-template-lint (deprecated-each, self-closing-void-elements).

## v0.5.0

- Initial migration of plugins from ember-cli-template-lint.
- Implement new node API for the Linter.
- Implement new result objects.
