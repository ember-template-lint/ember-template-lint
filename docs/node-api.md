# Node API

This plugin is written in ESM so consumers of its Node API must use ESM as well.

## Linter Class

Run templates through the linter's `verify` method like so:

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import TemplateLinter from 'ember-template-lint';

let linter = new TemplateLinter();
let template = readFileSync('some/path/to/template.hbs', {
  encoding: 'utf8',
});
let results = await linter.verify({ source: template, filePath: 'some/path/to/template.hbs' });
```

`results` will be an array of objects which have the following properties:

- `rule` - The name of the rule that triggered this warning/error.
- `message` - The message that should be output.
- `line` - The line on which the error occurred.
- `column` - The column on which the error occurred.
- `filePath` - The file path for the file containing the error.
- `source` - The source that caused the error.
- `fix` - An object describing how to fix the error.
