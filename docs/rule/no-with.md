# no-with

âœ… The `extends: 'recommended'` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

The use of `{{with}}` has been deprecated, you should replace it with either `{{let}}` or a combination of `{{let}}`, `{{if}}` and `{{else}}`.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
{{#with (hash name="Ben" age=4) as |person|}}
  Hi {{person.name}}, you are {{person.age}} years old.
{{/with}}
```

```hbs
{{#with user.posts as |blogPosts|}}
  There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts.
{{/with}}
```

```hbs
{{#with user.posts as |blogPosts|}}
  There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts.
{{else}}
  There are no blog posts.
{{/with}}
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
{{#let (hash name="Ben" age=4) as |person|}}
  Hi {{person.name}}, you are {{person.age}} years old.
{{/let}}
```

```hbs
{{#let user.posts as |blogPosts|}}
  {{#if blogPosts.length}}
    There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts.
  {{/if}}
{{/let}}
```

```hbs
{{#let user.posts as |blogPosts|}}
  {{#if blogPosts.length}}
    There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts.
  {{else}}
    There are no blog posts.
  {{/if}}
{{/let}}
```
