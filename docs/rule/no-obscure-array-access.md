# no-obscure-array-access

âœ… The `extends: 'recommended'` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

ðŸ”§ The `--fix` option on the command line can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

Using obscure expressions `{{list.[1].name}}` is discouraged and is likely to be deprecated soon.
This rule recommends the use of Ember's `get` helper as an alternative for accessing array values.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
<Foo @bar={{@list.[0]}} />
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
<Foo @bar={{get @list '0'}} />
```
