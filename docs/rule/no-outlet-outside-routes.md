# no-outlet-outside-routes

The `{{outlet}}` helper is used to specify locations into which routes may be rendered. Typically, to keep routing clear, only route templates should make use of `{{outlet}}`. Using `{{outlet}}` outside of a route template, e.g. in a component or a partial, will often lead to unexpected rendering locations for child routes.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following (except in routes):

```hbs
{{outlet}}
```
