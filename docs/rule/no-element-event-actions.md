## no-element-event-actions

Using HTML element event properties such as `onclick` for Ember actions is not recommended for the following reasons:

* It doesn't work for SVGs (since there is no `onclick` property of `SVGElement`).
* It can lead to confusing and unexpected behavior when mixed with normal action usage. For a comprehensive explanation of why, read [Deep Dive on Ember Events].

The recommended alternative is the `on` modifier. `on` is available in Ember 3.11+ and by [polyfill](https://github.com/buschtoens/ember-on-modifier) for earlier versions.

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
<button onclick={{action "submit"}}>Submit</button>
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
<button {{on 'click' this.submit}}>Submit</button>
```
