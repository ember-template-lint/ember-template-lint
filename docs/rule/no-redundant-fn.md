# no-redundant-fn

âœ… The `extends: 'recommended'` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

ðŸ”§ The `--fix` option on the command line can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

The `fn` helper can be used to bind arguments to another function. Using it
without any arguments is redundant because then the inner function could just
be used directly.

This rule is looking for `fn` helper usages that don't provide any additional
arguments to the inner function and warns about them.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
<button {{on "click" (fn this.handleClick)}}>Click Me</button>
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
<button {{on "click" this.handleClick}}>Click Me</button>
```

```hbs
<button {{on "click" (fn this.handleClick "foo")}}>Click Me</button>
```
