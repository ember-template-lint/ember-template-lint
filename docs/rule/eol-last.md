# eol-last

Require or disallow newline at the end of files.

Enforce either (without newline at end):

```hbs
<div>test</div>
```

or this (with newline at end):

```hbs
<div>test</div>
{{!-- newline would be here  --}}
```

## Configuration

The following values are valid configuration:

* "always" - enforces that files end with a newline
* "editorconfig" - requires or disallows final newlines based your projects `.editorconfig` settings (via `insert_final_newline`)
* "never" - enforces that files do not end with a newline'
