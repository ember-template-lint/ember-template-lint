## no-invalid-link-text

Screen readers call up a dialog box that has a list of links from the page, which users refer to decide where they will go. But if many of the links in that list simply say "click here" or "more" they will be unable to use this feature in their screen reader, which is a core navigation strategy.

This rule checks links containing a few default words("click here" and "more"), and is configurable so additional words can be added as appropriate for your project. Disallowed list: click here, more info, read more, more. 

### Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
<LinkTo>click here</LinkTo>
```

```hbs
<a href={{link}}>more</a>
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
<LinkTo>Click here to read more about common accessibility failures</LinkTo>
```

```hbs
<a href={{link}}>Read more about semantic html</a>
```
