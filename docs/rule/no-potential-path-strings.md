# no-potential-path-strings

It might happen sometimes that `{{` and `}}` are forgotten when invoking a
component, and the string that is passed was actually supposed to be a property
path or argument.

This rule warns about all arguments and attributes that start with `this.` or
`@`, but are missing the surrounding `{{` and `}}` characters.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
<img src="this.picture">
```

```hbs
<img src="@img">
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
<img src={{this.picture}}>
```

```hbs
<img src={{@img}}>
```

## Migration

- Replace the surrounding `"` characters with `{{`/`}}`
