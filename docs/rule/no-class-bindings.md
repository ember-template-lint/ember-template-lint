# no-class-bindings

âœ… The `extends: 'recommended'` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

It is possible to pass `classBinding` and `classNameBindings` as arguments to a component when invoked with curly syntax.

```hbs
{{some-component classNameBindings="foo:truthy:falsy"}}
```

These arguments are merged into the `class` attribute, whether or not the component is a classic component (which contains the `classNameBindings` logic).

This rule disallows use of `classBinding` or `classNameBindings` on components.

## Examples

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
{{some-thing classBinding="lol"}}no
```

```hbs
<SomeThing @classBinding="lol" />
```

```hbs
{{some-thing classNameBindings="lol:foo:bar"}}
```

```hbs
<SomeThing @classNameBindings="lol:foo:bar" />
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
{{some-thing}}
```

```hbs
<SomeThing />
```

## Migration

- find in templates and remove `classBinding` and/or `classNameBindings`.
